<p>Working in IX is all about collaborating in a larger group. We're a large group but we don't work independently. We work very closely with product managers, designers, and engineers. </p>

<p>A typical information experience assignment is not very different from any other content development assignment. Except there is a lot of close interaction with the customers (listening into research sessions or reading research reports), and trying to understand what the user really needs. </p>

<p>You'll also collaborate a lot with other content development teams like marketing, the education team, with tech support, testing. </p>

<a id="whats-the-end-goal-with-ix" class="anchor" href="#whats-the-end-goal-with-ix" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's the end goal with IX?</h2>

<p>IX is not about technical documents, it's not about UI editing. It's about looking at the customers' experience more holistically and producing what the customer truly needs. And for that to happen you have to collaborate with everybody else. </p>
